# Portfolio-Sprint2

In this repository, you will find the completion of my personal portfolio page. 

I finished up creating this page by adding some finishing touches to the small details of my website. 

I added a favicon image that is displayed in the title of my portfolio when opened up in a computer browser. Next, I created meta tags to help promote my portfolio through social media. 

Lastly, I added Privacy Policy, Terms and Conditions, & a cookies policy page as well as a cookies pop-up. I am collecting data by using Google Analytics, as specified throughout these pages. 

# What I learned

I learned how to create a favicon image and inteegrate it into my website.

I learned how to draft a Privacy Policy and a Terms and Conditions, learning about the components of each.

I also learned how to make a pop-up window within a website.
